> 📖 **Background**: These Skills emerged from my widely-read Medium article ["Claude Skills: The AI Feature That's Quietly Changing How Product Managers Work"](https://medium.com/product-powerhouse/claude-skills-the-ai-feature-thats-quietly-changing-how-product-managers-work-aad5d8d0640a), where I documented how Skills transformed my daily PM workflow, saving 3-4 hours per week.

## What Are These Skills?

Claude Skills are reusable, specialized procedures that teach Claude your exact workflows. Instead of re-explaining your PRD format or meeting notes structure every time, you create a Skill once and Claude automatically applies it whenever relevant.

Think of Skills as "onboarding guides" for Claude—they package your best practices, templates, and processes so Claude consistently delivers outputs the way you want them.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- **Product Managers** looking to automate repetitive documentation tasks
- **PM Teams** wanting to standardize processes and share best practices
- **Anyone** tired of reformatting Claude's outputs to match their standards

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Prerequisites**: You need Claude Pro, Team, or Enterprise account
2. **Enable Code Execution**: Settings → Features → Enable "Code Execution and File Creation"
3. **Install Your First Skill**:
   - Download the [`prd-template`](skills/prd-template) folder
   - Zip the folder (it should contain SKILL.md and any other files)
   - Rename the .zip to .skill (e.g., `prd-template.skill`)
   - Go to claude.ai → Settings → Skills → Upload Skill
   - Try it: "Help me write a PRD for a mobile app onboarding feature"

That's it! Claude now knows your PRD format.
