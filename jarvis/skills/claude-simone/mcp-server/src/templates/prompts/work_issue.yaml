  # Work GitHub Issue
  
  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
  
  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 6 items:
  
  1. Fetch and understand issue content
  2. Assess information quality and gather missing details
  3. Create detailed implementation plan
  4. Setup development branch
  5. Implement the solution
  6. Prepare and create pull request
  
  ## 1 · Fetch and understand issue content
  
  {{#if issue}}
  Fetching issue #{{issue}} content
  {{else}}
  {{#if github.github_projects.enabled}}
  ### Check GitHub Projects Work Queue
  
  Query items from the work queue status:
  ```bash
  gh project item-list {{github.github_projects.project_id}} --owner {{github.repository}} --format json | jq '.items[] | select(.status == "{{github.github_projects.work_status}}")'
  ```
  
  If work items are found:
  - List them with their titles and descriptions
  - Ask the user which item they want to work on
  - Get the associated issue number if the item is linked to an issue
  
  If no work items are found or user doesn't select one:
  {{/if}}
  Ask the user what they want to work on.
  {{/if}}
  
  {{> github}}
  
  {{#if issue}}
  Fetch issue #{{issue}} details to understand the requirements.
  {{else}}
  Once an issue is selected, fetch its details to understand the requirements.
  {{/if}}
  
  Read the issue content carefully and identify:
  - Core problem or feature to implement
  - Technical requirements listed
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Referenced files or components
  - Any linked issues or context
  
  Read all comments on the issue:
  - Fetch and read issue comments
  - Consider them as additional context
  - Comments may contain clarifications, edge cases, or updated requirements
  - Weigh comments in but don't take them as absolute requirements
  
  Check if local repository is synchronized with remote:
  - Verify if the local branch is up to date
  - If not synchronized, ask user to choose between:
    - Pull/fetch latest changes
    - Work from current point and branch off
  - Ensure all remote work is included before starting
  
  ## 2 · Assess information quality and gather missing details
  
  Evaluate the issue information completeness:
  - Are implementation steps clear?
  - Are affected files identified?
  - Is the expected behavior well-defined?
  - Are there edge cases to consider?
  
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  If critical information is missing, ask the user for clarification.
  {{else if (gte project.riskLevel 5)}}
  Use research tools to fill knowledge gaps:
  - Search the codebase for related implementations
  - Review similar past issues and PRs
  - Check documentation for architectural patterns
  
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 10)}}
  If questions remain after research, ask the user for clarification
  {{else}}
  Document any assumptions you're making based on project context
  {{/if}}
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 3 · Create detailed implementation plan
  
  Based on the issue requirements and codebase analysis, create a step-by-step plan:
  
  1. List all files that need to be modified or created
  2. For each file, specify the changes needed
  3. Identify the order of implementation
  4. Note any dependencies between changes
  5. Consider testing requirements
  
  Follow the project's development principles and conventions.
  
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  Present the implementation plan to the user and ask if the approach looks good.
  {{else}}
  Proceed with the implementation plan
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 4 · Setup development branch
  
  Determine branch type based on issue labels:
  - If labeled as "bug" or fixing existing functionality: `bugfix/`
  - If labeled as "feature" or "enhancement": `feature/`
  - Otherwise, analyze issue content to determine appropriate prefix
  
  Create a descriptive branch name based on the issue.
  
  Ensure you're on the correct branch before starting implementation.
  
  ## 5 · Implement the solution
  
  Work through your implementation plan systematically:
  
  - Start with the foundational changes first
  - Implement each file modification according to the plan
  - Follow existing code patterns and style
  - Add necessary imports and dependencies
  - Handle error cases appropriately
  
  After each significant step in your plan:
  - Log the activity using the log_activity tool
  - Verify the changes work as expected
  - Run any relevant tests or build commands
  
  Continue implementation until all items in your plan are completed.
  
  {{> quality-checks}}
  
  {{#unless features.workflow.autoCommit}}
  ## Manual Testing Checkpoint
  
  ✅ **Implementation complete!** The code changes have been implemented but not yet committed.
  
  **Please test the changes manually before proceeding.**
  
  When you're ready to commit and create a pull request, confirm by saying "proceed with commit" or similar.
  
  **Pause here and wait for user confirmation before continuing to step 6.**
  {{/unless}}
  
  ## 6 · Prepare and create pull request
  
  Stage and commit your changes.
  
  Create a commit with a descriptive message.
  
  Push the branch to remote.
  
  Define PR details:
  - Title: "[Type]: Brief description"
  - Body should include:
    - Summary section with "Closes #{{issue}}"
    - Reference to issue #{{issue}} for automatic cross-linking
    - Changes made with any decisions or trade-offs
    - Testing performed and edge cases considered
    - Any potential issues needing review
  
  Create the pull request with the title and body defined above, ensuring it links to issue #{{issue}}.
  
  After successfully creating the pull request, switch back to the base branch:
  - Detect the base branch (the branch this feature/fix branch was created from)
  - Use `git merge-base HEAD origin/master` or check tracking info to identify base branch
  - Run: `git checkout [base-branch]`
  - Confirm you're back on the base branch
  
  ✅ **Result**: [Describe actual outcome of implementation and pull request creation]
  
  🔎 **Scope**: Modified [N] files, added [N] lines, removed [N] lines
  
  💬 **Summary**: [Provide honest summary of what was accomplished, any issues encountered, and current status of the implementation]
