  # Create GitHub Issue
  
  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
  
  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 7 items:
  
  1. Gather issue details and context
  2. Analyze project structure and relevance  
  3. Research codebase for technical context
  4. Assess complexity and scope
  5. Structure issue content
  6. Apply GitHub metadata
  7. Create the GitHub issue
  
  ## 1 · Gather issue details and context
  
  {{#if title}}
  Using provided title: "{{title}}"
  {{else}}
  Ask the user: "What is the new issue about? Provide a brief title and detailed description."
  {{/if}}
  
  Interview the user to understand:
  - Core problem or feature request
  - Expected behavior or outcome
  - Current behavior (if applicable)
  - Is this connected to other entities (issues, PRs, milestones)?
  {{#if related_issue}}
  - Connected to issue #{{related_issue}}
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 2 · Analyze project structure and relevance
  
  Read {{PROJECT_PATH}}/README.md and key documentation files to understand:
  - Project purpose and architecture
  - Technology stack and dependencies
  - Development conventions
  
  
  Evaluate if the user input makes sense in the project context:
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  If unclear, ask the user for clarification about project fit
  {{else if (lte project.riskLevel 7)}}
  Research the web for similar implementations and patterns
  Ask the user if critical context is still missing
  {{else}}
  Document any assumptions about project integration
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 3 · Research codebase for technical context
  
  Search the codebase to identify:
  - Related files and components
  - Existing implementations to build upon
  - Potential conflicts or dependencies
  - Code patterns to follow
  
  Search the codebase using appropriate tools to find relevant code patterns.
  
  List all files that will be affected by this issue.
  
  ## 4 · Assess complexity and scope
  
  Calculate complexity score (1-10):
  - 1-3: Simple changes, single file
  - 4-6: Multiple files, moderate logic
  - 7-8: Architectural changes, multiple components
  - 9-10: Major refactoring, system-wide impact
  
  If complexity score is greater than 5:
  - Consider if this should be split into multiple issues
  - Identify logical breakpoints
  - Suggest sub-issues if appropriate
  - Confirm approach with user
  - Add research links for complex implementations
  
  ## 5 · Structure issue content
  
  Structure the issue content with appropriate sections based on the issue type and complexity:
  
  - **Description**: [Clear statement of the problem or feature]
  - **Context**: Include project area, related issues{{#if related_issue}} like #{{related_issue}}{{/if}}, and complexity assessment
  - **Technical Details**: List affected files and components with explanations
  - **Requirements**: [Detailed requirements suitable for implementation]
  - **Implementation Steps**: [Create numbered checklist of specific actions]
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: [Define testable completion criteria]
  {{#if (gt complexity 5)}}
  - **Additional Resources**: [Include helpful links and documentation]
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 6 · Apply GitHub metadata
  
  {{> github}}
  
  Fetch existing labels from the repository:
  ```bash
  gh label list --repo {{github.repository}} --limit 100
  ```
  
  Select one or more labels that match this issue from the available labels.
  {{#if github.defaultLabels}}
  If the GitHub API fails, use these default labels: {{#each github.defaultLabels}}`{{this}}`{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
  {{/if}}
  
  ## 7 · Create the GitHub issue
  
  Create the issue with:
  - Title: "{{title}}"
  - Body: [Issue content from step 5]
  - Labels: [Selected labels from step 6]
  
  Create the issue using the title, body, and labels defined above.
  
  {{#if related_issue}}
  After creating the issue, link it to issue #{{related_issue}} by adding a comment that references the new issue number.
  {{/if}}
  
  {{#if github.github_projects.enabled}}
  ### Add Issue to GitHub Project
  
  Add the newly created issue to the project at the configured status:
  ```bash
  gh project item-add {{github.github_projects.project_id}} --owner {{github.repository}} --url [ISSUE_URL]
  ```
  
  Then update its status to the new issue status:
  ```bash
  gh project item-edit --id [ITEM_ID] --field-id [STATUS_FIELD_ID] --project-id {{github.github_projects.project_id}} --single-select-option-id [{{github.github_projects.new_issue_status}}_ID]
  ```
  
  The issue is now tracked in the project at status: `{{github.github_projects.new_issue_status}}`
  {{/if}}
  
  ✅ **Result**: [Describe the actual outcome - issue number created and any relevant details]
  
  🔎 **Scope**: [Describe the scope - complexity score, number of affected files, and project areas]
  
  💬 **Summary**: [Provide an honest summary of what was created, including the issue title, key requirements, and whether all necessary information was gathered]
