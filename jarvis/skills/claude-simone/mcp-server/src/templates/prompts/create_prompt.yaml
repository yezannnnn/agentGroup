  # Create New Simone Prompt

  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!

  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 7 items:

  1. Gather prompt requirements
  2. Analyze prompt purpose
  3. Define TODO structure
  4. Create detailed sections
  5. Add conditional logic
  6. Define output format
  7. Generate and save prompt

  ## 1 · Gather prompt requirements

  {{#if prompt_name}}
  Creating prompt: "{{prompt_name}}"
  {{else}}
  Ask the user: "What prompt do you want to create? Use underscores (e.g., 'review_code', 'deploy_app')"
  {{/if}}

  **CRITICAL:** Interview the user to understand:
  - What is the main purpose of this prompt?
  - What are the key steps? (aim for 5-9 main actions)
  - What information needs to be gathered from the user?
  - What should the output look like?
  - Are there risk-level based behaviors?
  - What could go wrong and how should it be handled?

  ## 2 · Analyze prompt purpose

  Based on user input, determine:
  - **Action verb**: CREATE, REVIEW, ANALYZE, UPDATE, etc.
  - **Target object**: issue, code, project, commit, etc.
  - **Required context**: What project info is needed?
  - **Dependencies**: Other prompts or tools required?

  ## 3 · Define TODO structure

  Create a numbered list of 5-9 high-level steps that:
  1. Start with gathering/validating input
  2. Include necessary research/analysis
  3. Cover the main action
  4. Include verification/quality checks
  5. End with structured output

  **VERIFICATION:** Each TODO item must be:
  - A single, clear action
  - Independently verifiable as complete
  - Essential to the prompt's purpose

  ## 4 · Create detailed sections

  For each TODO item, write a detailed section following this pattern:

  ```
  ## N · [Action verb + specific task]

  [Clear, imperative instructions]

  [For each argument used, consider what happens when it's missing:
  - Ask the user for the value?
  - Use a default behavior?
  - Search for the information?]
  
  [CRITICAL: Only reference actual commands/tools that exist
  - No pseudocode
  - No made-up function names
  - Verify commands exist in the codebase]

  [Specific steps with real commands or descriptive actions]
  ```

  ## 5 · Add conditional logic

  Identify where behavior should change based on:
  - **Risk level**: Use comparison helpers (lt, lte, gt, gte)
  - **Project type**: Use context length or specific flags
  - **Available tools**: Use feature helpers for optional capabilities

  Example patterns:
  ```handlebars
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  Ask user: "Should I proceed with [action]?"
  {{else}}
  Proceed with [action] and report results
  {{/if}}
  ```

  ### Using Partials

  Include these partials to keep prompts DRY:

  1. **GitHub operations**: Use `{{> github}}` then describe the operation
     ```handlebars
     {{> github}}
     
     Create a pull request with title "[Type]: Description"
     ```

  2. **Quality checks**: Use command partials
     ```handlebars
     {{> quality-checks}}
     ```
     Or individual checks: `{{> lint}}`, `{{> test}}`, `{{> typecheck}}`

  IMPORTANT: Don't create detailed tool instructions - the LLM knows how to use tools. Just tell it which tool is available via partials.

  ## 6 · Define output format

  Every prompt MUST end with:

  ```
  ✅ **Result**: [What was accomplished]

  🔎 **Scope**: [Specific items affected]

  💬 **Summary**: [One paragraph explanation]
  ```

  **CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:**
  - NO "Next steps" section with commands
  - Each section provides unique information
  - No pseudocode or non-existent features

  ## 7 · Generate and save prompt

  **PRE-GENERATION CHECKLIST:**
  □ All referenced commands exist in codebase
  □ Every argument has a missing-case strategy
  □ No invented functions or variables
  □ Output sections don't duplicate information
  □ No "Next steps" with fake commands

  Create the complete prompt YAML:

  ```yaml
  name: {{prompt_name}}
  description: [Clear, concise description]
  arguments:
    - name: [optional_arg]
      description: [What this argument provides]
      required: false
  template: |
    # [Action Verb] [Object]
    
    **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
    
    **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these [N] items:
    
    1. [First step]
    2. [Second step]
    ...
    N. [Final step]
    
    [Detailed sections for each TODO item]
    
    [Standard output format]
  ```

  Save to: `.simone/prompts/{{prompt_name}}.yaml`

  ✅ **Result**: [Describe actual outcome - prompt name created and location]

  🔎 **Scope**: [Describe what was created - prompt type and key features]

  💬 **Summary**: [Explain what was generated - number of steps, key features included, and how it follows the style guide]
