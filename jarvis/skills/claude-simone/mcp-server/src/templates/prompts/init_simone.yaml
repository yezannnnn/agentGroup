  # Initialize Simone Configuration
  
  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
  
  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 7 items:
  
  1. Check existing Simone files
  2. Analyze project structure
  3. Setup or update configuration
  4. Create or update constitution
  5. Create or update architecture document
  6. Verify Git and GitHub setup
  7. Complete initialization
  
  ## 1 · Check existing Simone files
  
  Check for the existence of these files in {{PROJECT_PATH}}/.simone/:
  - project.yaml (or project.yaml.template)
  - constitution.md (or constitution.md.template)
  - architecture.md (or architecture.md.template)
  
  Also check if {{PROJECT_PATH}}/CLAUDE.md exists (project-level Claude instructions).
  
  Document what exists and what's missing.
  
  If all core files exist (project configuration, constitution, architecture), get input from the user about what they want to update - configuration, constitution, architecture, or everything.
  
  ## 2 · Analyze project structure
  
  Use parallel Task agents to examine different folders simultaneously and understand:
  - What is the project about?
  - What programming language(s) is/are being used?
  - What framework(s) is/are used?
  - Which databases?
  - Is there any existing documentation/specification/guides?
  - Available scripts/commands
  - Directory organization and structure
  
  Determine if this project contains multiple independent packages/services or is a single unified codebase.
  
  If multiple packages/services detected, identify each as a separate context.
  
  Gather comprehensive information about the project's nature and technical stack.
  
  ## 3 · Setup or update configuration
  
  If project.yaml exists:
  - Read the existing configuration and verify/update
  
  If project.yaml does not exist:
  - Check if project.yaml.template exists
  - If template exists, copy it to project.yaml
  - If no template, create new project.yaml
  
  Fill in or update the configuration based on project analysis:
  
  - project.name: Project name from analysis or get from user
  - project.description: What the project is about
  - project.type: Set to "monorepo" if multiple packages detected, otherwise "single"
  - project.riskLevel: Get user preference for automation level (1-10 scale):
    - 1-3: Very careful, always ask for confirmation
    - 4-6: Balanced, confirm major changes
    - 7-10: More autonomous, minimal confirmations
  
  For contexts configuration:
  - Single unified codebase: Create one context
  - Multiple packages/services: Create one context for each
  - Analyze each context's technology stack separately
  
  For each context, configure:
  - stack: language, framework, database based on that context's code
  - tooling: commands specific to that context
  - methodology: development approach for that context
  
  Configure shared settings that apply across all contexts.
  
  - github: Set tool to "cli" and detect repository from git remote
  
  For features configuration:
  - Ask user: "Would you like to enable optional features?"
  - If yes, explain the feature:
    - **PR review wait**: Automatically wait for and check PR review status
  - Based on user preferences, configure:
    ```yaml
    features:
      pr_review_wait:
        enabled: [true/false based on user preference]
        initial_wait: 30    # seconds before first check
        poll_interval: 30   # seconds between checks
        timeout: 600        # max wait time (10 minutes)
        auto_merge: false   # whether to auto-merge if approved
    ```
  
  Write the updated project.yaml file.
  
  ## 4 · Create or update constitution
  
  If constitution.md exists:
  - Read it and ask if user wants to update any section
  
  If constitution.md does not exist:
  - Check if constitution.md.template exists
  - If template exists, copy it to constitution.md
  - If no template, create new constitution.md
  
  Fill in the constitution by:
  1. **Project info**: Get name and one-line description from user
  2. **Tech stack**: Detect language, framework, package manager from project files
  3. **Structure**: List key directories (only important ones like src/, tests/, etc.)
  4. **Essential commands**: Detect from package.json/Makefile/etc or ask user:
     - How to run the project
     - How to run tests
     - How to build/compile
  5. **Critical rules**: Ask user: "What are the MUST-FOLLOW rules for this project?"
     - Only include rules that are truly critical
     - Examples: "Never commit directly to main", "All code must be TypeScript"
  
  Keep it CONCISE - this gets included in every prompt!
  
  ## 5 · Create or update architecture document
  
  If architecture.md exists:
  - Read it and get feedback from the user about needed updates
  
  If architecture.md does not exist:
  - Check if architecture.md.template exists
  - If template exists, copy it to architecture.md
  - If no template, create new architecture.md
  
  Analyze the codebase structure and organization.
  
  For projects with multiple packages/services, document how they interact and relate to each other.
  
  Get input from the user about the system architecture and design decisions.
  
  Create or update comprehensive architecture documentation based on analysis and user input.
  
  ## 6 · Verify Git and GitHub setup
  
  Check Git repository status and GitHub integration.
  
  If anything is missing or misconfigured, get confirmation from the user before making changes.
  
  Update project.yaml with correct GitHub settings if needed.
  
  ### GitHub Projects Integration (Optional)
  
  Ask the user: "Would you like to integrate GitHub Projects for idea capture and work queue management?"
  
  If yes:
  
  1. **Find or create project**:
     - List existing projects: `gh project list --owner [owner]`
     - If no suitable project exists, get user confirmation to create new one
     - Create project if needed: `gh project create --owner [owner] --title "[Project Name]"`
  
  2. **Discover available statuses**:
     - Get project field data: `gh api graphql -f query='query{node(id:"[PROJECT_ID]"){...on ProjectV2{fields(first:20){nodes{...on ProjectV2SingleSelectField{name options{name}}}}}}}'`
     - Extract status field options
     - Display available statuses to user
  
  3. **Configure status mappings**:
     - Ask user to map statuses for:
       - idea_status: Where draft ideas are captured (e.g., "Ideas", "Draft")
       - work_status: Where to pull work items from (e.g., "Ready", "Todo")
       - new_issue_status: Where newly created issues go (e.g., "Backlog", "New")
  
  4. **Update configuration**:
     ```yaml
     github:
       repository: owner/repo
       tool: cli
       github_projects:
         enabled: true
         project_id: PVT_[ID]
         idea_status: [selected status]
         work_status: [selected status]
         new_issue_status: [selected status]
         available_statuses: [list of discovered statuses]
     ```
  
  ## 7 · Complete initialization
  
  Check if {{PROJECT_PATH}}/CLAUDE.md exists:
  
  If CLAUDE.md exists:
  - Ask the user: "Would you like to add activity logging instructions to your CLAUDE.md file?"
  - If yes, append this section to CLAUDE.md:
    ```
    ## Activity Logging
    
    You have access to the `log_activity` tool. Use it to record your activities after every activity that is relevant for the project. This helps track development progress and understand what has been done.
    ```
  
  If CLAUDE.md does not exist:
  - Inform the user: "No CLAUDE.md file found in your project. Please run Claude Code's project initialization to create this file first, then re-run Simone init to add activity logging instructions."
  
  Summarize what was created or updated and any manual steps needed.
  
  Use log_activity to record the initialization/update:
  - activity: "Initialized or updated Simone configuration for project"
  - tool_name: "init_simone"
  - tags: ["configuration", "setup"]
  - files_affected: List all created/modified files
  
  ✅ **Result**: [Describe what was actually done - initialized or updated, which files were created]
  
  💬 **Summary**: [Explain what was completed - configuration created/updated, documentation prepared, and current status]
